# NFT Collateralized Lending Platform

The NFT Collateralized Lending Platform is a decentralized application that allows NFT owners to use their assets as collateral for loans. Utilizing the Diamond Proxy standard, this platform is modular and upgradeable, enabling seamless integration of multiple facets to manage lending, finance, staking, and ownership functions. This project aims to offer NFT holders liquidity options while maintaining asset ownership, with secure and transparent lending and repayment procedures.

## Overview

The platform is designed to enable secure, collateralized loans against NFTs. By locking NFTs in escrow, borrowers can access loans while lenders are safeguarded against default risk through collateral transfer mechanisms.

## Key Features

**NFT Collateralization:** NFTs are securely locked as collateral during the loan term.

**Diamond Proxy Architecture:** Structured with facets to allow dynamic, modular upgrades and functionality management.

**Repayment and Liquidation:** Borrowers can repay loans based on agreed terms, with collateral transferred to the lender on default.

**NFT Staking and Finance Management:** Added flexibility with NFT staking for finance optimization.

## Project Structure

The following facets organize the platform’s functionality:

### Facets

**DiamondCutFacet:** Manages the addition, replacement, or removal of functions in the Diamond Proxy, allowing smooth upgrades.

**DiamondLoupeFacet:** Provides inspection capabilities, allowing retrieval of facet addresses and functions in the diamond.

**ERC721Facet:** Implements the ERC-721 standard for NFT compatibility, including transfer and ownership functionalities.

**LoanFacet:** Facilitates loan requests, loan term creation, issuance, and collateral management. NFT assets are locked as collateral here.

**ManageFinanceFacet:** Handles loan repayments, interest calculation, and financial management of funds.

**NFTStakeFacet:** Allows staking of NFTs for added financial flexibility, with staking rewards and yield mechanisms.

**OwnershipFacet:** Manages ownership and access control, ensuring only authorized users can interact with specific functions.
